Hello, 

I am a PhD-student at SLU-Aqua since 2015 studying the effects of size-dependent predator-prey interactions on individual performance, population dynamics, multi-species management and bioaccumulation of hazardous substances using Atlantic salmon as my model species and the Baltic Sea as my study system. I have a broad general interest in aquatic ecology but I am primarily interested in doing research focusing on fish ecology and I find the bridge between theoretical, experimental and empirical studies fascinating. My PhD-project is mainly based on empirical studies and hypothesis testing, using large datasets of collected data from the 1950s to present time. In addition, I will also develop a theoretical size-strucutred biomass model to theoretically study the effects of size-dependent predator-prey interactions on the population regulation of anadromous fish. 

Before starting my PhD-studies, I took my masters degree at Stockholms University in Marine Ecology and conducted my master thesis project within the Plant-Fish project during which I spent a lot of time both in the field and in the lab doing stomach content analyses on perch and pike.

If you have any questions about my research or want to contact me for wathever reason, please reach out!
