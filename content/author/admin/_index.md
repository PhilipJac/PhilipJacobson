Hello, 

I am a PhD-student at SLU-Aqua since 2015, studying the effects of size-dependent predator-prey interactions on individual performance, population dynamics, multi-species management and bioaccumulation of hazardous substances using Atlantic salmon as my model species and the Baltic Sea as my study system. I have a broad general interest in aquatic ecology and I am primarily interested in research focusing on predator-prey interactions and fish ecology. My PhD-project is mainly based on empirical studies and hypothesis testing using datasets collected from the 1950s to present. I am currently developing a size-structured biomass model to theoretically study the effects of size-dependent predator-prey interactions, management actions and productivity differences on anadromous fish population regulation. 

Before starting my PhD-studies, I took my masterâ€™s degree at Stockholm University in Marine Ecology. I conducted my master thesis within the research project Plant-Fish during which I spent a lot of time both in the field and in the lab.

If you have any questions about my research or want to contact me for whatever reason, please reach out!
