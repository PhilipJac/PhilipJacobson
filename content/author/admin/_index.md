Hello, 

I am a PhD-student at SLU-Aqua since 2015, studying the effects of size-dependent predator-prey interactions on individual performance, population dynamics, multi-species management and bioaccumulation of hazardous substances using Atlantic salmon as my model species and the Baltic Sea as my study system. My PhD-project is mainly based on hypothesis testing using data collected from the 1950s to present. I have a broad general interest in aquatic ecology and I am primarily interested in research focusing on predator-prey interactions, fish migration and predation effects on aquatic communities.

Before starting my PhD-studies, I took my masterâ€™s degree at Stockholm University in Marine Ecology. I conducted my master thesis within the research project Plant-Fish during which I spent a lot of time both in the field and in the lab conducting stomach content analyses.

If you have any questions about my research or want to contact me for whatever reason, please reach out!
